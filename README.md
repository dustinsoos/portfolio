# portfolio

version 1

In this HTML webpage I used html/css/bootstrap/and a little bit of javascript

html - with the use of classes and organization for an easy time labeling styles

css - is how I styled the color and text of the webpage

bootstrap - used this for the buttons/grid column layout/ and responsiveness of the website!

javascript - used this specifically for the drop down menu!
